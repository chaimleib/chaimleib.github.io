Here are some recordings I created.

If you are using an iPad or iPhone, make sure that the silent mode switch on your device is off. Otherwise, the audio will not play.

## Episodes

{% assign tracks = site.audio | sort: 'order' %}
<ol class="post-list">
{% for track in tracks %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ track.url }}">
      #{{ track.order }} â€“ {{ track.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>
