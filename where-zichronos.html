  <h1>Where are the Zichronos?</h1>
  <p>
    In previous versions of my website, I included recordings of beautiful
    memoirs that chasidim recorded about the Lubavitcher Rebbe.
  </p>
  <p>
    I regret that I had to do it, but my web host reduced the capabilities of
    my server, and it is no longer possible to host as much content as I used
    to. I have been hosting these zichronos for free for the past few years,
    and I found even then that I was running up against the limits of what the
    my host's server could do. I was technically unable to continue adding
    content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, in mid-2023, things suddenly got worse. I tried to deploy a tiny
    text-only update, and the deploy failed because processing all the audio
    took too much time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In case things change, I have saved the data in the
    <code><a href="https://github.com/chaimleib/chaimleib.github.io/tree/pre-zichronos-cut">pre-zichronos-cut</a></code>
    branch on my GitHub repository for this site. I hope someday the zichronos
    will return and be updated better than before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I apologize for the sudden change.
