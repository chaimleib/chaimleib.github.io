I had a little trouble with my Razer Anansi keyboard. I like that it has so many useful buttons and I love the backlight, but I found that certain keys, like the left shift, have too much static friction when I press them. So, I decided to get some plastic-safe lubricant for them.

![CRC 2-26]

The CRC 2-26 I got turned out to be a *bad* choice. It was not the grease I was expecting, but a thinner substance. Worryingly, it said it had petroleum distillates, although I was reassured that the front advertised "Plastic Safe" in bold italics. I sprayed it at close range onto a Q-tip and brushed it onto the plastic holes that rubbed against the keys.

Unfortunately, the CRC 2-26 actually increased the friction, making my keyboard nearly unusable for fast typing. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that although it might be plastic-safe, it was designed for metal-on-plastic and not plastic-on-plastic.

I'm going to try again with Super Lube grease. Hopefully the thicker consistency will be just the thing.

### Update (2014-11-23)
I applied the grease to both the keys and the holes for the larger-than normal keys on the right and left of my keyboard, and waited a few weeks to see what happens with time.

At first, the greased keys worked smoothly, but sluggishly. I probably used too much grease; it's likely enough to just grease the hole or just the key, not both.

Over time, they began working more quickly. Now, there is a noticeable difference in the friction of the greased and un-greased keys. Even the letter keys are noticeably creaky and sticky compared to the the greased ones. I am going to completely grease my keyboard now.
