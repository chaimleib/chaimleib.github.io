R' Michoel Lipskier brings a Sefer Torah, and the Rebbe joins the farbrengen by surprise afterwards.

## Ha'aros • Notes
My father told me this story, and added the following: “The Rebbe called me (R’ Michoel) over and told me quietly that there will be a farbrengen after davening.” (As Tzvi Hirsh told to Rabbi Schapiro)
