  <p>I am open for work. <a href="/resume"><strong>See my resume!</strong></a></p>
  <p>
    My most recent job was architecting microservices at Evernote. Systems that
    I have designed remain popular and in-use today, some more than a decade
    after I first released them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have an eye for creating code worth more than its weight in gold, that
    other engineers love to use. Will you let me do the same for you?
  </p>
  <h2>Where are the Seligson Zichronos?</h2>
  <p>
    I regret that I had to do it, but my host reduced the capabilities of my
    server, and it is no longer possible to host as much content as I used to.
    I have been hosting these zichronos for free for the past few years, and I
    found even then that I was running up against the limits of what the my
    host's server could do. I was technically unable to continue adding
    content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, in mid-2023, things suddenly got worse. I tried to deploy a tiny
    text-only update, and the deploy failed because processing all the audio
    took too much time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A hard decision had to be made: What content to remove? The two most
    resource-intensive parts of my site were the Schapiro Zichronos and the
    Seligson Zichronos. I decided to remove the Seligson Zichronos because it
    was a less-polished part of my site. I may have to remove the
    Schapiro Zichronos as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    In case things change, I have saved the data in the
    <code>pre-zichronos-cut</code> branch on my GitHub repository for this
    site. I hope someday the zichronos will return and be updated better than
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I apologize for the sudden change.
