  <p>I am open for work. <a href="/resume"><strong>See my resume!</strong></a></p>
  <p>
    My most recent job was architecting microservices at Evernote. Systems that
    I have designed remain popular and in-use today, some more than a decade
    after I first released them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have an eye for creating code worth more than its weight in gold, that
    other engineers love to use. Will you let me do the same for you?
